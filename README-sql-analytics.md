# AdventureWorks SQL Analytics

T-SQL project covering business intelligence reporting and database operations.

## Overview

SQL analytics project demonstrating business reporting, customer analysis, and data maintenance operations on AdventureWorks database. Covers product analysis, customer profiling, category hierarchies, sales metrics, and CRUD operations.

## Project Scope

**Five Analytical Areas:**
1. **Product Analysis**: Price categorization, markup calculations, NULL handling
